## 1. What is the Future Scope of your project?

Ans:
- `Industrial and manufacturing sectors`: Obstacle-avoiding robots can be used to perform tasks in areas that are too hazardous for humans, such as in chemical factories, nuclear power plants, or mining operations.

- `Healthcare and medical applications`: Obstacle-avoiding robots can be used to transport medical equipment, supplies, and medication within a hospital or healthcare setting, reducing the risk of contamination and increasing efficiency.

- `Smart homes`: Obstacle-avoiding robots can be used in smart homes as autonomous cleaners or to transport items from one room to another, without colliding with obstacles.

- `Agricultural industry`: Obstacle-avoiding robots can be used in agriculture to autonomously navigate through fields and orchards, inspect crops, and detect and remove weeds, increasing efficiency and reducing costs.

- `Public safety and security`: Obstacle-avoiding robots can be used in various public safety applications such as patrolling restricted areas, monitoring hazardous materials, and detecting potential threats, reducing the risk of human casualties.

## 2. There is this project in the world,but why do you choose this?

Ans : 
- To make something big we have to know the basics.
- We know that `Tesla` has invented a Car where this Technology is used.
- We are here just representing the Technology.We can make a cleaning bot for Smart Home using this Technology.

## 3. How does the Ultrasonic Sensor Work?

Ans:
- An ultrasonic sensor emits high-frequency sound waves and then measures the time it takes for the sound waves to bounce back after hitting an object.
- The sensor sends out a pulse of sound waves and waits for the waves to bounce back.
- The time taken for the waves to return to the sensor is used to calculate the distance of the object from the sensor.

## 4. Is it an Obstacle Avoiding Car or Obstacle Avoiding Robot?

Ans:
- This is an Obstacle Avoiding Robo-Car.
- Both obstacle avoiding cars and obstacle avoiding robo car are designed to navigate through an environment autonomously while avoiding obstacles. The main difference between the two is that an obstacle avoiding robo car is typically a simple robotic car that is pre-programmed to avoid obstacles, while an obstacle avoiding car is a more advanced that can make decisions based on its environment using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.

## 5. What is Arduino Uno?

Ans: 
- The Arduino Uno is based on the ATmega328P microcontroller, which is responsible for processing data and controlling the board's behavior.
- It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog input pins, and can be programmed using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- The Arduino Uno is open-source hardware, which means the design and schematics are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

## 6. What is the gear ratio of the BO Gear Motor?

Ans: 
- Without knowing the specific model of the motor, it is difficult to provide an exact gear ratio. However, it is common for gear motors to have gear ratios between 10:1 and 1000:1.

- For example, if the gear ratio of a 150 rpm bo gear motor is 50:1, this would mean that the output shaft would rotate 50 times for every 1 rotation of the input shaft. Therefore, the output shaft speed would be:

  - Output shaft speed = Input shaft speed / Gear ratio
  - Output shaft speed = 150 rpm / 50
  - Output shaft speed = 3 rpm

I will suggest you to read the `Working Principle` and `Component Detailes` carefully to answer the maximum number of questions.
