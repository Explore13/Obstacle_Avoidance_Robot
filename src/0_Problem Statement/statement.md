## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design and implement an `autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot` using the given components. The robot should be able to navigate through an environment by using the `ultrasonic sensor` to detect obstacles and move around them by controlling the `BO motor` with the `L293D motor driver`. The servo motor should be used to control the direction of the ultrasonic sensor, allowing the robot to scan its surroundings. The robot should be powered by a `3.7 V` battery and be capable of moving in any direction using the wheels. The robot should be programmed using `Arduino Uno` to respond to the ultrasonic sensor readings and adjust its movement accordingly, effectively avoiding obstacles in its path. The goal is to create a robust and reliable robot that can navigate through a variety of environments, avoiding obstacles and finding the optimal path to its destination.
