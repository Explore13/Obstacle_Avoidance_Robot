## WORKING PRINCIPLE
An obstacle-avoiding robot is an autonomous robot that is designed to detect and avoid obstacles in its path. The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and a servo motor to steer the robot in a different direction. The robot also uses a gear motor and wheels to move around.

The heart of this robot is the Arduino Uno. The Arduino is a microcontroller board that can be programmed to control different components of the robot. The Arduino board receives input from the ultrasonic sensor and processes it to determine the distance of the obstacle. If the obstacle is within a certain range, the Arduino sends a signal to the L293D motor driver shield to stop the gear motor from moving forward and activate the servo motor to change the direction of the robot.

The L293D motor driver shield is used to control the gear motor that powers the wheels. It can control two motors simultaneously and can also control the direction of the motors. The shield receives commands from the Arduino board and regulates the power to the gear motor accordingly.

The ultrasonic sensor is used to detect obstacles in the path of the robot. It works by sending out high-frequency sound waves that bounce off objects and return to the sensor. The time taken for the sound waves to return is used to calculate the distance of the obstacle.

The servo motor is used to steer the robot in a different direction when an obstacle is detected. It can rotate to a certain angle to change the direction of the robot. The servo motor receives commands from the Arduino board and moves accordingly.

The 3.7V battery is used to power the Arduino board, L293D motor driver shield, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and gear motor. The battery is small and lightweight, making it perfect for use in the robot.

Lastly, the gear motor and wheels are used to move the robot around. The gear motor is connected to the wheels and provides the necessary torque to move the robot forward. The wheels are made of rubber and provide traction to move the robot over different surfaces.

In conclusion, the working principle of an obstacle-avoiding robot using an Arduino Uno, L293D motor driver shield, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, 3.7V battery, gear motor, and wheels is a perfect example of how different components can work together to achieve a common goal. By using this robot, we can reduce the risk of accidents caused by obstacles in the path of a moving vehicle. Thank you for your attention.
